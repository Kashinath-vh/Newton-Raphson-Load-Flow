# Newton-Raphson-Load-Flow
This is the repo for the load flow solution by Newton-Raphson method in C++.
The Jacobian is inverted using Shipley's method, which is a numerical method.
For a clear understanding of the Newton-Raphson load flow method refer book POWER SYSTEM ANALYSIS by John J. Grainger and William
D. Stevenson, Jr.

The code has been tested on g++ compiler. The line and load data is stored in input files, and the results are written in nrlfop.txt file
